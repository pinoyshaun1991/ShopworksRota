# Shopworks Rota Test

This staff rota has been built using Laravel 5.6. There are also unit tests located within the tests/Unit/RotaTest, however I came across some problems when trying to run thr unit tests. 

Please find below the instructions on how to set up the test:

1). Run 'php artisan migrate' to migrate the database schema.

2). Import the data from the data.sql file to the database staff

3). As the main files used were pointed at the index route, simply head to the home directory on your browser and you should have a rota table appear.
